#-----------------
# Function: f_PathOfScript
#-----------------
# Returns the location of the script, irrespective of where it
# was launched.  This is useful for scripts that look for files
# in their current directory, or in relative paths from it
#
#-----------------
# Usage: f_PathOfScript
#-----------------
# Returns: <PATH>
